title: Can I just attend a rehearsal to see if it’s for me?
caption: Absolutely! We encourage anyone interested in joining to come along to a rehearsal. It’s the best way to see how we operate, meet the band, and get a feel for whether it’s something you’d enjoy. Either contact us to arrange a visit, or just turn up at one of our regular rehearsal sessions; Tuesdays, 19:00, RBL Chingford, 67 Hall Ln, London E4 8HW. We look forward to welcoming you!
