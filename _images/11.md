    Welcome to the Epping Forest Pipe Band!
    
    Founded in 1974 in Chingford, England, we are a traditional Scottish pipe band dedicated to sharing our love of music at corporate and community events. For over half a century, we’ve proudly performed at notable occasions like the VJ parade for the Chingford Royal British Legion and the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Walk.
    
    Our band values loyalty, friendship, and family. We welcome everyone, from beginners to experienced musicians, offering a supportive environment to learn and perform the Great Highland Bagpipes or drums.
    
    Rooted in Scottish tradition, we strive to inspire joy and pride at parades, competitions, and celebrations while fostering a friendly and inclusive community.
