title: How much does it cost to join EFPB?
caption: We ask a £20 per year membership fee, to cover the cost of renting the rehearsal hall each week, and that you buy your instrument. You can spend as much or as little as you like, though we usually recommend bagpipes that cost around £1000 and drums that cost around £500. If they are looked after well, they will outlive you!
