title: Can you play specific tunes on request?
caption: Yes, we are happy to accommodate special tune requests where possible. Let us know your preferred tunes in advance, and weâ€™ll work to incorporate them into the performance. If a requested tune is not already in our repertoire, our experienced pipers and drummers will do their best to learn it.
