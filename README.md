## Background

This is the official website for the Epping Forest Pipe Band, built using Jekyll and based on the Multiverse template. The site showcases our band's activities, history, and gallery.

### A Brief History of Our Website
- 2004: The late, great Alan Ronaldson created our first site at epping-forest-pipe-band.com using “ntlworld homepage”.
- 2006: We moved to efpb.org, the site was rebuilt from scratch in raw HTML.
- 2011: The site transitioned to WordPress, improving content management.
- 2018: We upgraded to a more polished version of WordPress.
- 2025: The fifth iteration arrives—hosted on GitHub Pages with a renewed focus on the band’s life and work.


### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
As far as we are aware, we are the only Bagpipe band in the world who practices Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for our website. We use GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the site when changes are pushed to the main branch, and we [do not use feature branches](https://youtu.be/v4Ijkq6Myfc). This means that the website is always up-to-date and reflects the latest changes. If you belong to a Bagpipe band that also uses CI/CD, please let us know in an issue!

We have the following jobs in GitHub Actions:
1. `deploy.yml` - builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages
2. `generate_thumbnails.yml` - generates thumbnails for images in the gallery
3. `analyse_workflows.yml` - analyzes GitHub workflow files for security and best practices using zizmor

#### Deploy
The `deploy.yml` job is triggered by,
- a push to the main branch, excluding changes to the `assets/images/fulls` directory.
- the completion of the `generate_thumbnails.yml` job.

This ensures that the site is rebuilt when there are any changes as well as once thumbnails have been generated for any new pictures added to the gallery.

#### Generate Thumbnails
The `generate_thumbnails.yml` job is triggered by,
- a push to the main branch of the `assets/images/fulls` directory.

This ensures that the thumbnails are generated for any new pictures added to the gallery.

#### Analyse Workflows
The `analyse_workflows.yml` job is triggered by,
- a push to the main branch of the `.github/workflows` directory.
- a schedule of once a month at 00:00 UTC.

This ensures that the workflows are analysed for security and best practices whenever they are changed and also once a month to check for any new security vulnerabilities since we last made changes.
